    <p>It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.</p>
    <p>The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:</p>
        <div>

        </div>
        <p><i>"What is that object?"</i></p>
        <p><i>"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."</i></p>
        <p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.</p>
        <p>He cried out, then:</p>
        <p><i>"What! You dropped down from the sky?"</i></p>
        <p><i>"Yes," I answered, modestly.</i></p>
        <p><i>"Oh! That is funny!"</i></p>
        <P>And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.</P>
        <p>Then he added:</p>
        <p><i>"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"</i></p>
        <p>At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly:</p>
        <p><i>"Do you come from another planet?"</i></p>
        <p>But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:</p>
        <p><i>"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."</i></p>
        <p>And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.</p>
        <p>You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.</p>
        <p><i>"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"</i></p>
        <p>After a reflective silence he answered:</p>
        <p><i>"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."</i></p>
        <p><i>"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."</i></p>
        <p>But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:</p>
        <img src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/malyPrincHvezdy.jpg" alt="">
        <p><i>"Tie him! What a queer idea!"</i></p>
        <p><i>"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."</i></p>
        <p>My friend broke into another peal of laughter:</p>
        <p><i>"But where do you think he would go?"</i></p>
        <p><i>"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."</i></p>
        <p>Then the little prince said, earnestly:</p>
        <p><i>"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"</i></p>
        <p>And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:</p>
        <p><i>"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..."</i></p>
